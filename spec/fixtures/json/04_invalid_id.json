The quartet converged in the studio over a few humid Minneapolis summer days last year and emerged with a fire-and-ice sound that binds organic elements (dual drums, punchy basslines) with more alienating aspects like manipulated vocals and undulating and robotic laptop beats. Leaneagh is unabashed in her use of Auto-Tune and bends the effect to her will, letting just enough of her lyrics slip through the chromatics to reveal the deep sorrow and loss that inspired their debut, <em>Give You the Ghost</em>. It's an album that resonated immediately with a local fanbase already familiar with the band member's previous projects (producer Ryan Olson's Gayngs, Leaneagh's Roma di Luna); their mesmerizing live shows ignited a national spark at SXSW and have kept them on the road touring the U.S. and Europe ever since. <em>--</em> <em>Andrea Swensson, <a href=\"http://thecurrent.org\" target=\"_blank\">89.3 The Current in the Twin Cities</a></em></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/specials/2012/12/Polica%20-%20Lay%20Your%20Cards%20Out.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download: \"Lay Your Cards Out\"</a></strong></p>   </div>   <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" --></div><!-- END ID=\"RES166746473\" CLASS=\"BUCKET LISTITEM SIMPLELISTITEM\" --></li>         <li><div id=\"res166746338\" class=\"bucket listitem simplelistitem\">      <h3>John Fullbright</h3>   <div id=\"res166748689\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\" previewTitle=\"Oklahoma's John Fullbright.\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\">                  <img src=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/07/f010-fullbright-bdshoot-mar2012-033-vrf_20120330_144008-c5f81e4871348ab24f78ddad77b6f86f02e4671a-s2.jpg\" title=\"Oklahoma's John Fullbright.\" alt=\"Oklahoma's John Fullbright.\" />         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn\" title=\"Enlarge\">Enlarge image</a>         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn enlarge-smallscreen\" title=\"Enlarge\">i</a>      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"IMAGEWRAP\" -->      <div class=\"captionwrap\">                  <div class=\"caption\">                        <p><i>Oklahoma's John Fullbright.</i></p>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTION\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTIONWRAP\" -->         </div>   <div class=\"bucketblock\">            <p>There is so much flavor on John Fullbright's debut, <em>From the Ground Up,</em> it could please folks accustomed to anything from soul to folk, to indie pop. It's not every day a new artist shows up out of the red Oklahoma dirt — Woody Guthrie's hometown, to be exact — and earns comparisons to great songwriters like Townes Van Zandt and Randy Newman, but Fullbright's music makes sense in such lofty company. His songs toss around themes of god and lust and faith and doubt like they're all dirty shirts that have been worn for too long. Take \"Jericho.\" Its gospel organ and dark, slogging rhythm support lyrics about searching for something — be it love or forgiveness, truth or transcendence. Everything here is on even ground — the profound as important as the profane. For Fullbright even the road to glory must be built from the ground up. <em>--Kim Ruehl, <a href=\"http://www.folkalley.com\" target=\"_blank\">FolkAlley.com</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"http://www.folkalley.com\" target=\"_blank\"></a></em><strong><a href=\"http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/specials/2012/12/John%20Fullbright%20-%20Jericho.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download: \"Jericho\"</a></strong></p>   </div>   <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" --></div><!-- END ID=\"RES166746338\" CLASS=\"BUCKET LISTITEM SIMPLELISTITEM\" --></li>         <li><div id=\"res166746508\" class=\"bucket listitem simplelistitem\">      <h3>Savoir Adore</h3>   <div id=\"res166750827\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\" previewTitle=\"Savoir Adore's Deidre Muro and Paul Hammer.\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\">                  <img src=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/07/savoiradore_ournaturephoto4_4-2eed3db56a2ace1f58226e7efb473bb9c609d415-s2.jpg\" title=\"Savoir Adore's Deidre Muro and Paul Hammer.\" alt=\"Savoir Adore's Deidre Muro and Paul Hammer.\" />         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn\" title=\"Enlarge\">Enlarge image</a>         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn enlarge-smallscreen\" title=\"Enlarge\">i</a>      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"IMAGEWRAP\" -->      <div class=\"captionwrap\">                  <div class=\"caption\">                        <p><i>Savoir Adore's Deidre Muro and Paul Hammer.</i></p>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTION\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTIONWRAP\" -->         </div>   <div class=\"bucketblock\">            <p>Savoir Adore's Deidre Muro and Paul Hammer sculpt exuberant synth-pop spun from fantasy concepts — their partially Kickstarter-built sophomore album, <em>Our Nature,</em> is a concept album loosely involving unrequited, otherworldly lovers surreptitiously meeting by riverbanks and wooded glens. But longtime friends Muro and Hammer — and their three bandmates — intuitively sharpen their dreamy dialogues with wiry, earthy hooks and defiant dance beats: the result is an ingenious marriage of esoteric artistry and easy accessibility. Tracks like \"Regalia,\" a percussive collision of the Cocteau Twins and the Spice Girls or the sweet, early-morning sunbeam of \"Dreamers\" are perfect pop manna.

Recently the city has seen a resurgence in creative energy with bands like Dr. Dog, War On Drugs, Work Drugs, Lushlife and Strand of Oaks representing the City of Brotherly Love. While there's no shortage of fantastic new bands from various genres, we decided to look to soul music for one of our best new artists. From The Sound Of Philadelphia to the Roots, Philly has always been steeped in soul. Singer-songwriter Aaron Brown is an exciting new name to add to the lineage of the city's expressive and emotionally intense soul singers. His self-released his album, <em>Sing,</em> recorded with some Philly scene up-and-comers backing him up and performing as The Spell, is an excellent new addition to the musical landscape. <em>--Bruce Warren, <a href=\"http://www.wxpn.org\">WXPN</a> program director in Philadelphia</em></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/specials/2012/12/Aaron%20and%20The%20Spell%20-%20Don't%20Cry.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download: \"Don't Cry\"</a></strong></p>   </div>   <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" --></div><!-- END ID=\"RES166746320\" CLASS=\"BUCKET LISTITEM SIMPLELISTITEM\" --></li>         <li><div id=\"res166746332\" class=\"bucket listitem simplelistitem\">      <h3>Graham Dechter</h3>   <div id=\"res166747939\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\" previewTitle=\"Los Angeles jazz guitarist Graham Dechter.\">            <div class=\"imagewrap\">                  <img src=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/12/07/grahamdechter1-aef349a21423cc9ce62fe6c5aa49b55d5f70187c-s2.jpg\" title=\"Los Angeles jazz guitarist Graham Dechter.\" alt=\"Los Angeles jazz guitarist Graham Dechter.\" />         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn\" title=\"Enlarge\">Enlarge image</a>         <a href=\"#\" class=\"enlargebtn enlarge-smallscreen\" title=\"Enlarge\">i</a>      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"IMAGEWRAP\" -->      <div class=\"captionwrap\">                  <div class=\"caption\">                        <p><i>Los Angeles jazz guitarist Graham Dechter.</i></p>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTION\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"CAPTIONWRAP\" -->         </div>   <div class=\"bucketblock\">            <p>Graham Dechter is a talented young guitarist who started composing music at a young age (he's the child of professional musicians & music educators).

Infusing old-school soul and girl-group sounds with modern day indie pop, it was the most upbeat number amongst an impressively well-polished collection of slow burners on the quintet's debut <em>The Hands That Take You.</em> Earlier this year, the band followed with the <em>Cool Nightmare</em> EP, Lizzy Ellison's captivating voice presiding over a kind of bossa nova fever dream with one sparse composition often running into the next. The group impressed repeatedly on stages throughout the year, whether delivering a complexly reworked version of one of their songs or a note-perfect take on Etta James staple \"At Last.\" All reasons to say Radiation City is Portland's best new band.

CGT's parent company, NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage, reports <a href=\"http://www.ngts.com/en/about-us/sissonville2.aspx\">the explosion occurred just before 1 P.M</a>. Sumwalt says there were no reports of a gas odor and no 911 calls were placed ahead of the blast.</p>   <p>Federal officials are also examining a 20-foot hunk of the pipe flung off by the force of the blast; they're going to take undamaged pipe sections near the breach for comparison and analysis.</p>   <p>There was a gas explosion in about the same region in 2002, Sumwalt acknowledged, but no link has been determined to this event. He was firm during a press briefing that no information would be released until it was verified - he noted that before NTSB investigators came to the scene north of Charleston, they were incorrectly told by the company that the pipe was larger than it turned out to be.</p>   <p>Searching is still treacherous at the site. When NTSB officials went to the pipe breach, they had to take along gas detectors and couldn't use their cameras or phones, because of the danger of sparks. However, I-77 remains open to travelers.</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2012 National Public Radio.
